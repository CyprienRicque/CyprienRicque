### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my profile !

🌱 I am a 4th year Epitech student currently in exchange at Tsinghua University in CS department.<br>

⚡My initial education is sofware engineer, but being really interested in data related fields I am majoring in data science, machine learning and data engineering. Since I am not sure which one I want to work in yet, I am practicing them all through Tsinghua University courses, personnal projects, books and MOOCs.
